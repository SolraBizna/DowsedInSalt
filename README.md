This is a mod for [Vintage Story](https://vintagestory.at) 1.18 and later.

Have you ever been so drunk that you started to sense the presence of buried halite domes within a ten meter radius of where you're standing? No? Install this mod and experience that feeling for yourself. The drunker you are, and the saltier your surroundings, the louder will be the sound of the "shikka shikka" in your ears. If you're standing right on top of the dome and sauced to your gills, it will be truly deafening!

(If you are hearing impaired, sorry. [Email me](mailto:solra@bizna.name), and I will get off my ass and make a version of this mod with a purely visual cue.)
